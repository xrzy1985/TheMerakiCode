<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C# has rich set of built-in operators and provides the following type of operators:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Misc Operators</li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial explains the arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and other operators one by one.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
<p>Following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by C#. Assume variable <strong>A</strong> holds 10 and variable <strong>B</strong> holds 20 then:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Relational Operators</h2>
<p>Following table shows all the relational operators supported by C#. Assume variable <strong>A</strong> holds 10 and variable <strong>B</strong> holds 20, then:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>Following table shows all the logical operators supported by C#. Assume variable <strong>A</strong> holds Boolean value true and variable <strong>B</strong> holds Boolean value false, then:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>

<h2>Bitwise Operators</h2>
<p>Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit by bit operation. The truth tables for &amp;, |, and ^ are as follows:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>

<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; then in the binary format they are as follows:</p>
<p>A = 0011 1100</p>
<p>B = 0000 1101</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>A&amp;B = 0000 1100</p>
<p>A|B = 0011 1101</p>
<p>A^B = 0011 0001</p>
<p>~A&nbsp; = 1100 0011</p>
<p>The Bitwise operators supported by C# are listed in the following table. Assume variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13, then:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&amp;</td>
<td>Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.</td>
<td>(A &amp; B) = 12, which is 0000 1100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>|</td>
<td>Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.</td>
<td>(A | B) = 61, which is 0011 1101</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^</td>
<td>Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.</td>
<td>(A ^ B) = 49, which is 0011 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>~</td>
<td>Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.</td>
<td>(~A ) = 61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement due to a signed binary number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;&lt;</td>
<td>Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;&gt;</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
<p>There are following assignment operators supported by C#:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=</td>
<td>Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand</td>
<td>C = A + B assigns value of A + B into C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+=</td>
<td>Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
<td>C += A is equivalent to C = C + A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-=</td>
<td>Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
<td>C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>*=</td>
<td>Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
<td>C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/=</td>
<td>Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand</td>
<td>C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%=</td>
<td>Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand</td>
<td>C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;&lt;=</td>
<td>Left shift AND assignment operator</td>
<td>C &lt;&lt;= 2 is same as C = C &lt;&lt; 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;&gt;=</td>
<td>Right shift AND assignment operator</td>
<td>C &gt;&gt;= 2 is same as C = C &gt;&gt; 2</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>|=</td>

<td>C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Miscellaneous Operators</h2>
<p>There are few other important operators including <strong>sizeof, typeof</strong> and <strong>? :</strong>supported by C#.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sizeof()</td>
<td>Returns the size of a data type.</td>
<td>sizeof(int), returns 4.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>typeof()</td>
<td>Returns the type of a class.</td>
<td>typeof(StreamReader);</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&amp;</td>
<td>Returns the address of an variable.</td>
<td>&amp;a; returns actual address of the variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>*</td>
<td>Pointer to a variable.</td>
<td>*a; creates pointer named 'a' to a variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>? :</td>
<td>Conditional Expression</td>
<td>If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>is</td>
<td>Determines whether an object is of a certain type.</td>
<td>If( Ford is Car) // checks if Ford is an object of the Car class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>as</td>
<td>Cast without raising an exception if the cast fails.</td>
<td>Object obj = new StringReader("Hello");
<p>StringReader r = obj as StringReader;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Operator Precedence in C#</h2>
<p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects evaluation of an expression. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.</p>
<p>For example x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so the first evaluation takes place for 3*2 and then 7 is added into it.</p>
<p>Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators are evaluated first.</p>
