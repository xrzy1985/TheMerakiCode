    <h2><center>Intoduction</center></h2>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                I am a recent graduate of Kennesaw State University's College of Computing and Software Engineering with a 3.71 GPA
                majoring in computer science. I graduated from Dalton State College with an A.S. in computer science, and then proceeded to move
                to Kennesaw to attend Southern Polytechnic State University to start working on a B.S. in computer science. SPSU was eventually
                merged with Kennesaw State University, and that is how I became a Kennesaw State University student. I followed the computer
                science curriculum while trying to focus on database design, software engineering, and various information technology classes.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">

                The first class I signed up for at SPSU was Introduction to Databases in the Fall of 2014. The further I progressed into
                my degree, the more I used databases to keep track of the information required or generated from the work assigned by my professors.
                While the application would be correctly functioning, the application would need to store all of the information created.
                The information that would be stored inside of the database tables entails encrypted passwords, object details, general
                information, and randomly generated numbers. Introduction to Software Engineering was the first class to presented a
                final project with the option to use a database.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                The final project for Intro to Software Engineering was to create a windows based application that could possibly be used
                by a local company. The team and I decided to write a library media management application in Visual Basic. VB would allow
                us to learn a new language, use object oriented principles while using a Turing complete language, and simplify the
                GUI design process. The GUI would have taken longer than the project time if developed using Java, C++, C, C#, etc.
                The application would allow users to check out media, check in media, request media, and the different media options
                were literature, audio, video, and magazine. The application would allow users to log in, log out, create a user,
                and the application would encrypt their passwords before storing to ensure that unencrypted passwords were never stored inside
                a database table. The information technology classes helped me understand the security side of computer science.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                An application is only reliable if the security measures in place are up to date, implemented correctly, and consistently
                monitored for vulnerabilities. Security is a vital aspect of any application in the modern world. Hackers are always looking
                to steal your information to be used online in one way or another. A good programmer should understand how to stop attacks
                if possible. Phishing, SQL injection, Cross-site scripting, Denial of Service, and Man in the Middle attacks are just a few of
                the different attacks a good programmer should be aware of, and should try to write code that will thwart these attacks if possible.

            Meraki is a social based web application for sharing tutorial information on the following languages: Java, C++, C#, Python, and SQL is
            in progress. The future implementations would be AngularJS, Swift, C, and Unity game engine. The website was originally designed for
            an Internet Programming course at Kennesaw State University. This specific course had a few specific requirements that were to be met in
            order to receive a good grade.

        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>
                The project requirements must..
            </h4>

            1. Incorporate a front end using html, css, and javascript to create dynamic functions within the html
            page. The professor allowed us to use Flask's built in code referred to as Jinja2 to create functionality and dynamic ability within the
            web application. Jinja2 is similar to the way AngularJS utilizes javascript to create dynamic functionality within front end
            web pages.

            <br><br>

            2. Incorporate any object oriented language we wish to use to manage the back end functionality; java, python, c++, c#, vb, etc.

            <br><br>

            3. Connect to the student's Capstone project if the student is currently enrolled in the course while enrolled in the Internet Programming course.

            <br><br>

            4. Have proper documentation on project requirements, scope, planning, time lines, code, sources, testing, group work breakdown, and information gathered.

            <br><br>

            5. Should be accessible through the internet, and the group is to think larger than local machine scope.

            <br><br>

            With the requirements in place, the idea arose to collect the programming knowledge obtained throughout the last four years into
            one place. The idea of creating a website to host tutorial information on various different topics of programming would be a large
            enough scale of a project to encompass the group project goal. Pythonanywhere would provide the group with a cheap way to host
            our group's web application. Pythonanywhere allows users to create web applications using Django, Flask, or similar microframeworks.
            Flask uses Python to handle the GET and POST requests on the back end. The front end of Meraki is handled using HTML5, CSS3, Twitter's
            Bootstrap library, javascript, and Flask's build in Jinja2 code. James was enrolled in the required Internet Programming course and
            the computer science Capstone course in the same semester, and the two would need to connect in one way or another. The project would
            incorporate public key encryption techniques to encrypt messages between users, encrypt files with a password to send to other users
            , and a functional login system to hash, store, and compare the passwords entered by users that would be used in both projects. The two
            independent projects were two separate entities, but the functions were both written within Flask using Python on the back end. Our team
            structured the project using the Agile methodology to achieve the end goal. Our product owner, Clay Cain, kept the team focused on what
            information needed to be gathered, what functionality must be met, helped gather resources for C++ and C#, and documenting the required paperwork for the project. Our team
            lead, James Gowdy, kept the team on track by creating time lines, helped to gather needed resources on Java, and helped solve problems that arose
            during development. Lead developer, James Patterson, handled researching the best options for web hosting, wrote all front end and back end
            functionality, and gathered resources for the languages Python and SQL.
