How to access the website

1. go to pythonanywhere.com
2. login
	jpatte95@students.kennesaw.edu
	admin.1234.admin
3. Consoles: Shows you what consoles (bash: python, mysql, etc) are running

	We are using 
		Flask, 
		Jinja 2, 
		Python 3.5, 
		Bootstrap, 
		and some Javascript
4. Click on the Web Tab

	This is the server side GUI 
		You can trace down errors quickly
		check access
		etc
	Every time a python, css, html, etc is modified or created
		YOU MUST RELOAD THE WEB APP
		The big green button that says Reload jpatte95.pythonanywhere.com
		Once that is reloaded, you can safely navigate to the page or
			see the changes

5. Click on the Files Tab

	- /home/jpatte95 is the root directory for the flask project
	Click on meraki/ under directories
		We are now in the Meraki (app) flask app folder
		on the left: 
			static
			templates
			up
			
		are the only three folders we will need to use right now

		static is for static files such as
			css
			fonts
			photos
		templates are where the html pages are stored
			Open up header.html
				Navigate to lines 136-141

			{% block body %}

                            
				<!--    This is where your code will go    -->
                            
				<!--    The code that will extend this file    -->

                        
			{% endblock %}

			All of the other html files extend header.html
			header.html is our "main" html file sort of speak
			
			Go back to templates
			
			Open up 404.html	
				404 will display when there isn't a page present
				navigate to 
				https://jpatte95.pythonanywhere.com/hello/

			Click on the Navigation bar on the top right that says Navigation
			Notice how some of the page turns gray? The white part is what 
			is actually being extended and modified dynamically using flask

			up is an uploads folder
			You can upload a file that is in return encrypted
			The file can be seen as a download, but only a person
			with the key can access the file (decrypt)
			
			The file is stored on the server as enc_<filename>
			and returned to the user as dec_<filename>
			
6. Navigate to Meraki and click on content_management.py

	This is a dictionary of the information that will be required. This is how the
	Navigation bar uses the data. So, in order to add or delete, find the key and
	value, and remove the code. 

	PLEASE, DO NOT DELETE ANY CODE
	ONLY COMMENT CODE OUT, PLEASE

	Language	Code
	Python		# comment
			'''
			  comment	
			  comment '''
	HTML 		<!-- comment -->

7. Navigate to the meraki directory and click on flask_app.py
	
	flask_app.py is the "main" file of the flask application
	
	Take a look around the file
	it is a full fledged python file
	The file runs a specific virtual environment
	If you are to run a bash at all you must use the command
		workon fenv
	That will make sure the bash is using the fenv virtual env
	quit() to quit the bash console in python
	
Navigate to 400 - 440 ish and find 404 Error

	# app.route('/whatever_you_wish/')
	# will set up for jpatte95.pythonanywhere.com/whatever_you_wish	(with or without the /)
@app.route('/C++/')

	# function definition, make the name unique so you can access it in html
	# redirect(url_for( {{ function_name }} ))
def c_plusplus():
    
	try:
        
		return render_template("C_plusplus.html", page_dict=page_dict)

    # This just creates the html page at the html file
	except Exception as e:
        						  # The page_dict must be passed in everytime for every
		return(str(e))							  # page, its how you pass variables to html through python

8. Now navigate to the databases tab
	
	
	Start a console on:	jpatte95$meraki
	
	Click on jpatte95$meraki

	select * from users;

		Might change to add first name, last name, etc

	select * from uploads;

		Another table created 

	delete from users where username = "admin";

		will delete the user admin form the database

Moving forward

Start collecting your information into html friendly blocks

So, it can be read easily in the extended pages

when you create a html file
	navigate to meraki/templates
	on the right side
		it says enter a new file name in the bar
		tttestttt.html 
		will create a html file named tttestttt
